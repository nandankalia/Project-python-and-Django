#                                   +	    Addition	    x + y

#                                          print(20+30)

#                                     -	    Subtraction	    x - y	

                                           #print(30-20)
                                             
#                                   *	    Multiplication	x * y	

                                            #print(3*2)


#                                     /	    Division	    x / y	

#The Python code print(10/3) will output the result of the regular division operation, which includes the remainder. 
#print(10/3)
  #output = 3.3333333333333335


#                                     %	    Modulus	        x % y

#the % operator is used for the modulo operation, which calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another.


#                                     **	Exponentiation	x ** y	

#In Python, the ** operator is used for exponentiation. If you have variables x and y, x ** y calculates x raised to the power of y 
                                               #print(2**3)
                                             #output is 8

#                                      //	Floor division	x // y	

#The Python code print(10//3) will output the result of the floor division operation, which is the quotient without the remainder. 
#print(10//3)
  # output = 3

# Assignment operators  # assignment operators are used to assign values to variables #

# =: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
  
# x = 5

#  +=: Adds the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left.

# x = 5
# y = 3
# x += y  # This is equivalent to x = x + y
# print(x)  # Output: 8

# a = 5
# b = 3
# # a = a - b 
# a -= b 
# print(a)
## Output = 2

# a = 3
# b = 5
  # # a = a * b 
# a *= b 
   # print(a)
# # Output = 15



# a = 3
# b = 5
  # # a = a / b 
# a /= b 
  # print(a)
# # Output = 0.6


# a = 3
# b = 5
  
# # a = a % b 
# a %= b 
  # print(a)
# # Output 3

# a = 3
# b = 5
  
# # a = a ** b 
# a **= b 
#   print(a)
# Output = 243
